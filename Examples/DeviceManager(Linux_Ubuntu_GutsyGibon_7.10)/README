This first step example shows how to use the DeviceManager to establish a communication between two apps.

Each app loads plugins and declares a device corresponding to the other.
A device is added by giving it a name, the plugin to use, and some parameters like ip and port for Minuit or OSC plugin.

The ReceiveTestApp just waits messages. 
The receiveCallback method is called when a message is received and can be used to process the message.

The SendTestApp sends an OSC message to the ReceiveTestApp.

Now plugin parameters as reception ports are configurable.
You can call pluginSetCommParameter(...) method or pluginLoadConfigXml(...) if you want to use a xml config file (cf DeviceManager.h).

Makefiles are available to compile test programs.
If you want to use the Device Manager with your own app don't forget to add these option and libs (have a look Makefile compile command): 
-lDeviceManager
-ldl
-lpthread 
-rdynamic

First launch the ReceiveTestApp then the SendTestApp.
